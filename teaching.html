		<h2>Testimonials</h2>
		<div class="testimonial">
			<p>"Caleb has been a great music teacher for both our kids over the years. His vast knowledge in music, as well as creativity and personable manner, were a great fit for our kids who’d had some challenging experiences with other teachers in the past. He provided musical foundation for growth while allowing and encouraging them to explore their natural musical interests, from rock, to classical, improvisation and songwriting. I’d highly recommend Caleb!"</p>

			<p>"After fiddling around for many years with the guitar and the keyboard, Caleb lessons finally helped me understand music. I knew the &quot;theory&quot; of music theory, but applying it in practice to create my own compositions, with neat melodies and harmonies, has solidified the concepts in my mind. Not only can I now compose my own songs, it has helped me understand the musical meanings of the many songs I play. It has made me a better musician overall."</p>
